Websocket Client for PHP
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sirn-se/websocket-php.png)](https://travis-ci.org/sirn-se/websocket-php)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/sirn-se/websocket-php/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/sirn-se/websocket-php)

This package mainly contains a WebSocket client for PHP.

I made it because the state of other WebSocket clients I could found was either very poor
(sometimes failing on large frames) or had huge dependencies (Reactâ€¦).

The Client should be good.  If it isn't, tell me!

The Server there because much of the code would be identical in writing a server, and because it is
used for the tests.  To be really useful though, there should be a Connection-class returned from a
new Connection, and the Server-class only handling the handshake.  Then you could hold a full array
of Connections and check them periodically for new data, send something to them all or fork off a
process handling one connection.  But, I have no use for that right now.  (Actually, I would
suggest a language with better asynchronous handling than PHP for that.)

Install
-------
```bash
# Install composer
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

# Generate vendor/autload.php
php composer.phar install --no-dev

```

Client usage:
-------------
```php
require('vendor/autoload.php');

use WebSocket\Client;

$client = new Client("ws://echo.websocket.org/");
$client->send("Hello WebSocket.org!");

echo $client->receive(); // Will output 'Hello WebSocket.org!'
```
